# Instructions 

This cart is designed to flip up against a wall to save space when not in use.  This build is fairly dangerous; a LOT of weight can be thrown on this cart and it's not very strong in its current form.  

I no longer use the front wheels, they are hard to use and the weight transition is very scary. 

The rounded front drags easily enough for me.  When pulling away from the wall I can just pull from the top.  To go forward either grab the bottom edge and slide, or wedge the back wing with your foot, pull the top to distribute more wieght to the back wheels, then use your foot to slide it forward.

The design is done in openscad.  It requires some work before another one of these should be cut.
